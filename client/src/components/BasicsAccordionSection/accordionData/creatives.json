However, we have an extensive 'Quality Scoring' process which ensures that high quality creatives have the ability to continue to participate in the platform.

Based upon the quality of your submissions, you will continue to be assigned additional contests. Once you have received enough high ratings on your submissions, your account will be upgraded to 'Full Access', so that you can begin participating in all open contests."
